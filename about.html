                Hi! I'm Alex van Stekelenborg, a student at the University of Pittsburgh information, where studying information science. I was raised in Pennington, New Jersey. I've been on the internet ever since I learned to type, which I think was in 2nd grade. His time spent on the internet pushed me towards front end web development, as I wanted to learn how the websites I used actually worked. I'm a junior developer still, but the amount of libraries and frameworks that are available constantly renew my passion to learn more and more about web development. My resum√© below lists the skills that I have learned and am currently learning, and this website is a testing ground for me to learn whatever interests me at the time.
